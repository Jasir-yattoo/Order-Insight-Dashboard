# Order-Insight-Dashboard
### Power BI project for Order Insight

We first extracted the data from Database using Mysql and saved the data into a CSV file.

After extracting the Data, we loaded the data into Power BI, and using the Power Query we 
cleaned the Data removing all the duplicates and replacing all the errors from the Data.

Then we loaded the Data into the Power BI report view and created various Visualisations
such as Bar charts, donut charts, map charts, etc.
